# Hi, I'm Flamey.
I'm **Flamey**, or, by my real name, **Alex**. I'm a YouTuber, Redditor, and very active Discord user.

## What I use GitHub for.
I use **GitHub** to:
1) Develop my Discord Bots, like [**Earth**](https://github.com/ActuallyFlamey/Earth).
2) I'd really want to say I do more than... bots. I'll do something sooner or later, promised.
